# Il2cppDumpDroidGUI
This is [@Perfare's](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper) Modified version of il2cppDumper (GUI)  for Android

# Open-source
Obviously it's open-source (However i won't public the source code though).
It have open-dll's so you can decompile it to see source code ðŸ™ˆ

# Note
Before Downloading the apk file , you should know 
1) this app may have one or multiple bugs , that i can't guarantee I'll fix in future ðŸ™„
2) maybe your device not compatible for this app
3) at the end I'll say , this is not the app i wanted to make at the first place, due to lack of the resources i didn't make this app optimised .
4) But , maybe in future a better version of this app ( that i wanted to design) will come ! Bcz I've the resources now !
